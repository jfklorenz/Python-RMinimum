A **Python** implementation of the **RMinimum algorithm**.

The algorithm is presented in the paper **Fragile Complexity of Comparison-Based Algorithms** by Prof. Dr. Ulrich Meyer and others in 2019, which can be found on [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02857 "arXiv").

It introduces the concept of *fragile complexity*, i.e. the amount of times an element has been compared during the process of the algorithm.
